; reduce processes each element in sequence rolling them up to build a singular result, whilst a map processes each element in sequence to create new elements in a sequence
; (reduce f coll) or (reduce f val coll)

; reduce can be used to transform a mapâ€™s values, producing a new map with the same keys but with updated values
(reduce (fn [new-map [key val]]
          (assoc new-map key (inc val)))
        {}
        {:max 30 :min 10}) ; treats the argument {:max 30 :min 10} as a sequence of vectors, like ([:max 30] [:min 10])
; => {:max 31, :min 11}

; assoc [map key val] => derives a new map from given map by associating the given key with the given value

; maps, lists, vectors, they are all treated like sequences so a map to clojure is just a vector of pairs -- that is why they can be matched up and used in the same types of funcs

; reduce can also be used to filter out keys from a map based on their value

(reduce (fn [new-map [key val]]
          (if (> val 4)
            (assoc new-map key val)
            new-map))
        {}
        {:human 4.1
         :critter 3.9})
; => {:human 4.1}

; Whenever you want to derive a new value from a seqable data structure, reduce will usually be able to do what you need


; take, drop
; (take number sequence) => return first n elems in sequence
; (drop number sequence) => returns returns sequence with first n elements removed

; filter and some
; Use filter to return all elements of a sequence that test true for a predicate function.

(filter #(< (:human %) 5) food-journal)

; difference between filter and take-while
; take-while can be more efficient in this example, because the list is ORDERED and it will return data we want without
; examining any of the data we won't need. Because it is essentially a while loop. filter processes all the data before returning.

; some function, takes in a predicate func and returns a value
; used to determine if any elem in sequence is true for the following function
(some #(> (:critter %) 5) food-journal)
; => nil

(some #(> (:critter %) 3) food-journal)
; => true

(some #(and (> (:critter %) 3) %) food-journal)
; => {:month 3 :day 1 :human 4.2 :critter 3.3}

; sort and sort-by

; sort in asc order
(sort [3 1 2])
; => (1 2 3)

; sort-by is more complicated sorting. a
; allows you to apply a function (sometimes called a key function) to the elements of a sequence and use the values it returns to determine the sort order.
(sort-by count ["aaa" "c" "bb"])
; => ("c" "bb" "aaa")

; concat: appends members of one sequence to the end of another
(concat [1 2] [3 4])
; => (1 2 3 4)

; many funcs, like map and filter, return lazy sequences to save time (not actually implementing the func action until it has to)

; infinite sequences
(concat (take 8 (repeat "na")) ["Batman!"])
; => ("na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "na" "Batman!")
